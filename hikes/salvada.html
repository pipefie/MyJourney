                    <h2>Sierra Salvada - Alava</h2>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Sierra Salvada</strong>, located in Álava, is a dramatic and challenging mountain range that is known for its steep inclines and stunning landscapes. This hike is not for the faint-hearted, as the ascent is quite steep, but the rewards are worth it. My girlfriend and I found ourselves pushing our limits as we climbed, with every step offering increasingly breathtaking views.

                        Along the way, we encountered <strong>wild horses</strong>,a highlight of the hike, as well as <strong>birds of prey</strong> soaring above the cliffs. The raw beauty of the area — from the jagged peaks to the lush meadows — made it one of the most scenic hikes we have done in the Basque Country. The summit offers a panoramic view over the valleys below, and on clear days, you can see far into both Spain and the edge of the French border. The sense of accomplishment after conquering this hike was immense, and I'd highly recommend it for those seeking a real adventure.
