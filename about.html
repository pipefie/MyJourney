                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hey there! I'm a 25-year-old <strong>Data science student</strong> originally from Colombia, now living in the beautiful city of <strong>San Sebastián, País Vasco</strong>. I've been lucky enough to explore Europe since 2016 with my girlfriend, and traveling has become one of the most exciting parts of my life. I'm passionate about experiencing the world like a local, always seeking out the authentic side of every destination we visit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether it's hiking in the <strong>Selva de Irati</strong> or getting lost in the streets of <strong>Paris</strong>, I believe in the beauty of slow travel, taking my time to truly appreciate the culture, the people, and the stories behind each place. Museums are my go-to stops, and I never miss an opportunity to learn something new. Some of my favorites have been the <strong>Louvre</strong> in Paris and the <strong>Van Gogh Museum</strong> in Amsterdam, where art and history come to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Food is an important part of my travels, and I love to try everything I can. Whether it is indulging in <strong>tapas</strong> in Madrid, tasting the best <strong>croissants</strong> in Paris, or enjoying a <strong>stroopwafel</strong> in Amsterdam, I believe that food is one of the best ways to connect with the local culture. My girlfriend and I always seek out local spots to eat, steering away from the tourist traps, and finding those hidden gems that make the experience even more memorable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Traveling on a <strong>student budget</strong> has taught me how to make the most of every trip without breaking the bank. From staying in budget-friendly accommodations to using local transport and finding free or affordable activities, I've learned that you don't need a lot of money to have incredible adventures. It's all about being resourceful, curious, and open to new experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not traveling, you'll find me diving into a good book, exploring new hiking trails, or working on my <strong>data science projects</strong>. I believe that curiosity and learning go hand in hand, and I bring that same sense of discovery to my travels and studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So welcome to my journey! I hope my adventures inspire you to explore the world, try new things, and live life with a sense of wonder. There's so much out there to discover, and I'm excited to share it all with you.
