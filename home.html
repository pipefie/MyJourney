                    <h2>Welcome to my journeys until now</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm a 25-year-old <strong>data science student</strong> with a deep love for traveling and hiking. Since 2016, my girlfriend and I have been exploring Europe, soaking up the beauty and diversity this amazing continent has to offer.</p>
                    <p>We've been fortunate enough to visit incredible places in <strong>Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Italy</strong>, and one of our favorite things to do is hike in the <strong>northern regions of Spain</strong>. The combination of stunning landscapes and the challenge of hiking through mountains and forests has made these adventures some of the most memorable experiences of our lives.</p>
                    <p>As students, we often travel on a <strong>student budget</strong>, which means we have learned how to make the most out of every opportunity while keeping things affordable. Whether it's finding the best hiking spots, hidden gems in each country, or simply enjoying local culture without breaking the bank, we are always on the lookout for ways to maximize our experiences.</p>
                    <p>This blog is where I will be sharing our travels, tips for exploring Europe on a budget, and some of our favorite hikes. I hope it inspires you to pack your bags, grab your hiking boots, and see what the world has to offer, no matter your budget!</p>
